MDPath visualization
====================

Currently, two options for 3D visualization are integrated into MDPath.

**NGL Visualization**
==============


**Pymol Visualization**
==============
To visualize the paths in PyMOL, start by launching PyMOL according to your installation method.
Under the "File" menu, select the option "Run Script..." and navigate to the mdpath folder. 


.. figure:: /_static/images/pymol_run_script.png
   :figwidth: 725px
   :align: center



From there, select the vis_pymol.py script.
Now, you can run the script from the command line using the following command:

Afterward, you can execute the visualization steps in PyMOL as you normally would.
