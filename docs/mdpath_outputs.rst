MDPath Outputs
==============

This page focuses on the outputs generated by the main function of **MDPath**, which can be invoked using the `mdpath` prefix in the command line. These outputs can either be directly used for visualization or further processed using **mdpath-tools** for more in-depth analysis.

**3D Visualization Outputs**

The main data for 3D visualization is stored in the following `.json` files. These files can be directly visualized using tools such as **PyMOL** or **NGLViewer**, or they can be further post-processed for additional analysis.

    precomputed_clusters_paths.json        All paths are plotted individually, allowing for detailed inspection of each signaling pathway.
    quick_precomputed_clusters_paths.json  Every path within a cluster is precomputed, allowing for less rendering and faster inspections.

The following images can be useful for debugging purposes or for visualizing smaller protein systems. However, when dealing with larger protein systems, this representation may become too complex to fully comprehend.

    clustered_paths.png  A picture of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram, which illustrates how pathways are grouped based on similarity.
    graph.png            A picture of the complete graph, which can be useful for fine-tuning the `graphdist` parameter in certain systems.
