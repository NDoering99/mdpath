MDPath Outputs
==============

This page focuses on the outputs generated by the main function of **MDPath**, which can be invoked using the `mdpath` prefix in the command line. These outputs can either be directly used for visualization or further processed using **mdpath-tools** for more in-depth analysis.

**3D Visualization Outputs**

The main data for 3D visualization is stored in the following `.json` files. These files can be directly visualized using tools such as **PyMOL** or **NGLViewer**, or they can be further post-processed for additional analysis.

    precomputed_clusters_paths.json        All paths are plotted individually, allowing for detailed inspection of each signaling pathway.
    quick_precomputed_clusters_paths.json  Every path within a cluster is precomputed, allowing for less rendering and faster inspections.
