MDPath --- MD signal transduction calculation and visualization --- :mod:`mdpath.mdapth`
====================================================================

MDPath is a Python package for calculating signal transduction paths in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 
The package uses mutual information to identify connections between residue movements.
Using a graph shortest paths with the highest mutual information are calculated.
Paths are then clustered based on the overlap between them to identify a continuous network throught the analysed protein.
The package also includes functionalitys for the visualization of results.
