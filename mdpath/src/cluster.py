"""Clustering --- :mod:`mdpath.src.cluster`
==============================================================================

This module contains the class `PatwayClustering` which calculates the overlap between pathways and clusters them based on the overlap.
Clusters are generated through hirarcical clustering using scipy. Optimal cluster size is evaluated using the silhouette score.
